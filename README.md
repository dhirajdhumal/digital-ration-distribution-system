**Digital Ration Distribution System**

• Developed a MERN-stack web application to digitalize government ration distribution, featuring a secure
authentication system using JWT and bcrypt for users, admins, and officers. Built a scalable RESTful API with
Node.js and Express to manage ration allocation, stock tracking, scheme announcements, user complaints, and
time-slot scheduling, with integrated validation and role-based access control. Designed a responsive and
intuitive React frontend that allows users to view ration details, receive scheme updates, file fraud-related
complaints, and manage collection time-slots. Implemented an admin dashboard for monitoring distribution
workflows, verifying complaints, and ensuring transparent stock management.
